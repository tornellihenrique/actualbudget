# @actual-app/mcp-server

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets an AI assistant read
and manage an Actual budget: categorize transactions, maintain rules, reconcile
schedules, run bank sync and report on spending. It talks to a sync server
through `@actual-app/api`, built from the same commit, so it always understands
the budget's schema.

It serves Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` and is its own OAuth 2.1 authorization
server (dynamic client registration, PKCE, refresh tokens), so it can be added
as a custom connector in claude.ai (which also makes it available in the Claude
mobile and desktop apps), in Claude Code, or as a custom MCP app in ChatGPT.
Signing in asks for a single password on a page this server renders.

| `MCP_DAILY_BANK_SYNC`       |          | Include bank sync in the daily job. Defaults to `true`.                                                                                                                               |

## Safety

- Every change is appended to `audit.jsonl` with its previous values; the
  `get_change_history` tool reads it back.
- The budget is exported to `backups/` before the first change each day and by
  the daily job.
- Bulk rule application previews by default.

## Development

```bash
yarn build --scope=@actual-app/mcp-server
ACTUAL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5006 ACTUAL_PASSWORD=... \
  node packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js
claude mcp add --transport http actual http://localhost:5007/mcp
```

`yarn typecheck` emits `tsc` output into `packages/api/dist`, replacing the
bundled build the server loads at runtime; rebuild the API with
`yarn workspace @actual-app/api build` before running the server locally.
